## Image classification based on X-RAYS
_CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) - CNNs are useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories._
Import neccessary pakages like keras, tensorflow etc
LOAD TRAINING, TESTING AND VALIDATION X-Rays Image datasets for COVID-19, PNEUMONIA, TUBERCULOSIS (TB) seperately in Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the code... and create a model and save.

### Test each model for a new xray image and see predict a result by it's accuracy.
