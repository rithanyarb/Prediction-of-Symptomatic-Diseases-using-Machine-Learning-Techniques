## Image classification based on X-RAYS
_CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) - CNNs are useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories._

Download Jupyter Notebook.

Import neccessary pakages like keras, tensorflow etc.

Load TRAINING, TESTING AND VALIDATION X-Rays Image datasets for COVID-19, PNEUMONIA, TUBERCULOSIS (TB).

### Steps to follow:

***1) Download Pneumonia chest-xrays image dataset from kaggle and split into TRAIN, TEST and VALIDATION datasets
      eg. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.***
      
***2) Go to code Pneumonia XRAY test.ipynb and create a model and save it.***

***3) Do the same for TB(Tuberculosis)-TB testing.ipynb and Covid-19 -COVID-19 testing.ipynb.*** 

***4) Finally go to TESTING XRAY.ipynb and upload saved models of Pneumonia, TB and COVID-19 respectively.***

***Congratulations! Now you created a Disease Predicting Machine Learning Model.*** 


### OUTPUT RESULT : 
### Test each model with a new xray image and predict a result by it's accuracy.
